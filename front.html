    <p>Welcome, Nimechtlahp&aacute;loz, and Bienvenidos to my Mesoamerican Page! The more than 380 Prehispanic works here span from the northwestern regions of Mexico to southern Panama and over three thousand years of civilization in Mexico and Central America.</p>
    <p>The Mesoamerica pages contain images with my own commentary. Because many of these terms are in native languages and may be new to you, you may click on any <span class="pronounce">highlighted name</span> to hear me pronunce it. If you are interested in including a few of these images on your own site, make sure that you have <strong>my written permission</strong>, as these are my graphics.
